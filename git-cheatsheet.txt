>git init 
Initalise a repo

>git status
Changes made between working directory files and the previous commit.

working directory -> staging area -> repo

All files are "untracked" by Git until it's been told otherwise.

All files which are been worked upon are in the working directory. We can move any file to the staging area before comitting it.

Scenario:-

>git status

modified : filename 
( Changes made to a file in the working directory to a committed file not moved to the
staging area)

>git diff 
Compare changes in current working directory to the previous commit. (Compares to the head commit by default.)

>git diff <commit-hash>
provide a hash of the commit as the parameter to compare with a different commit.

>git diff <filename>
Comapre changes made to a single file.

>git difftool
Load an external tool of choice to view the comparison. (Easier to read)

** git diff will only comapre files in the working direcotry.

>git diff --staged
Compares files in the staging area.

> git log - allows to view the history of repo and the commit log.

>git log --pretty=format:"%h %an %ar - %s"
To view each commit on a single line.

>git show
Changes made in the commit
